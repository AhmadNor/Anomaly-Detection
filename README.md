# Anomaly Detection
The files contain programmes for real gas turbine dataset for anomaly detection.
Files with complete (optimized) weights: Bayes_Lstm_N1, Bayes_Lstm_P2, Bayes_Lstm_P4, Bayes_Lstm_T4. Here the anomaly detection and explanation are performed. Here also f'x and  f'x(v'\mf) are obtained for explanation evaluation purpose. 
Files with different weights (not optimized) for explanation evaluation purpose: Bayes_Lstm_N1-2, Bayes_Lstm_P2-2, Bayes_Lstm_P4-2, Bayes_Lstm_T4-2. Here Here also f''x and  f''x(v'\mf) are obtained for explanation evaluation purpose.
