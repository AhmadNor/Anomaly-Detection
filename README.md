# Anomaly Detection
The files contain programmes for real gas turbine dataset for anomaly detection.
Folders with complete (optimized) weights: Bayes_Lstm_N1, Bayes_Lstm_P2, Bayes_Lstm_P4, Bayes_Lstm_T4. Here the anomaly detection and explanation are performed. Here also f'x and  f'x(v'\mf) are obtained for "Local Accuracy" and "Consistency" evaluation purpose. 
Folders with different weights (not optimized) for explanation evaluation purpose only situated in "Consistency" folder: Bayes_Lstm_N1-2, Bayes_Lstm_P2-2, Bayes_Lstm_P4-2, Bayes_Lstm_T4-2. Here f''x and  f''x(v'\mf) are obtained for explanation evaluation purpose.
